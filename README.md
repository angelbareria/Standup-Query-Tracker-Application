# Standup-Query-Tracker-Application
The project Standup Query Tracker can be used to improve how we track blockers, questions, dependencies, and follow-ups raised during daily standups. 
Standup items like queries and blockers etc are shared through chats or emails. Over time, important points get missed, ownership isn’t clear, unresolved issues aren’t tracked, and there’s no visibility for management into recurring bottlenecks. Also a chain of these mails or chats are formed and it becomes difficult to look back into it and also creates duplicate queries.
A solution to this issue might be a web-based Standup Query Tracking System where team members can log standup items, assign owners, track status (Open/In Progress/Resolved), and monitor overdue items using simple SLA indicators.
